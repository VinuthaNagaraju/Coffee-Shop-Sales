## Coffee-Shop-Sales
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales data for a coffee shop chain, providing insights into total sales, order volume, product category performance, and location-wise trends. Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, and DAX for KPIs and time intelligence calculations (e.g., month-over-month comparisons). The dashboard featured dynamic filters, weekday vs weekend sales breakdowns, and top product sales visualizations, enabling data-driven decisions for marketing, operations, and inventory planning.
